Planning Inspiro

1. I want to welcome the user to Inspiro
2. Have the user choose between types of content: videos, articles, quotes
3. Scrape videos from TedTalks: https://www.ted.com/talks?sort=inspiring&topics%5B%5D=Technology&topics%5B%5D=Business
4. Scrape articles from Goalcast: https://www.goalcast.com/category/self-improvement/
5. Scrape quotes from Letterpile.com: http://www.wiseoldsayings.com/funny-motivational-quotes/
6. List each segment of content when requested


Issues remaining:
- Need to get link for articles (css selector still not working)
TODO: Keep working on scraping the url correctly

- Formatting issues with video list
TODO: Consider solutions
