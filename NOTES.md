Planning Inspiro

1. I want to welcome the user to Inspiro
2. Have the user choose between types of content: videos, articles, quotes
3. Scrape videos from TedTalks: https://www.ted.com/talks?sort=inspiring&topics%5B%5D=Technology&topics%5B%5D=Business
4. Scrape articles from Goalcast: https://www.goalcast.com/category/self-improvement/
5. Scrape quotes from Letterpile.com: https://letterpile.com/quotes/100-Inspirational-Sayings-Quotes-and-Phrases
6. List each segment of content when requested

Wishlist:
- Quotes are randomized
- Would like to make the content findable with a search feature
- Would like to categorize the content and be able to view each category
