Planning Inspiro

1. I want to welcome the user to Inspiro
2. Have the user choose between types of content: videos, articles, quotes
3. Scrape videos from TedTalks: https://www.ted.com/talks?sort=inspiring&topics%5B%5D=Technology&topics%5B%5D=Business
    - Users can get more details about the videos
4. Scrape articles from Goalcast: https://www.goalcast.com/category/self-improvement/
    - Users can get more details about the articles
5. Scrape quotes from Letterpile.com: http://www.wiseoldsayings.com/funny-motivational-quotes/
    - Users can get more details about the articles
6. Provides an exit option and a goodbye message
